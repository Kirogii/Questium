/**
 * The keep-or-evict half of the page cache.
 *
 * Distance is computed from chapter/index math rather than by walking the cache, which makes it
 * gap-proof but also means the *reference* matters: when a page's chapter no longer lists it - which
 * is exactly what a split does to the page it replaces - it has no position to measure from. These
 * tests pin how that case is classified.
