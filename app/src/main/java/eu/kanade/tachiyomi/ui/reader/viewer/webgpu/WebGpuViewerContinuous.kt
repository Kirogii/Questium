    // allowed to reach further than the cache holds (so the screen is fully painted when zoomed
    // out), but a speculative preload that wide created more shells than the cache keeps and

    // screen. Every page in that reach is created on demand here. A chapter boundary holds both
    // edge windows plus the transition page plus swap residue at once (up to ~13 live shells), so
    // the cache keeps that whole working set: evicting a half-visible decoded page reverts it to a
    // placeholder and its re-decode shifts every slot below it, which read as constant flicker at
    // chapter edges. Low-RAM devices keep the old tighter budget instead of risking OOM.
    //
    // KMK --> The reach therefore follows what the last frame drew rather than sitting at the
    // baseline count: a cache that cannot hold its own drawn window evicts pages that are on screen.
