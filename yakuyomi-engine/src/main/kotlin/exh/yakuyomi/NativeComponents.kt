/**
 * The three native sessions the pipeline needs, built and warmed together.
 *
 * The NCNN/ONNX backends are not thread-safe and are expensive to construct, so [YakuyomiEngine]
 * keeps exactly one instance alive and guards it with a mutex. Grouping them means a build either
 * yields all three or none, and teardown cannot forget one.
