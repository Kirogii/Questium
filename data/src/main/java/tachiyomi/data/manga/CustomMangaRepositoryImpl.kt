/**
 * Stores user-edited manga metadata in the `custom_manga_info` table.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a plain SQLDelight query
 *
 * [tachiyomi.domain.manga.model.Manga] snapshots its custom info in a `@Transient`
 * property initialiser so that every reader of a `Manga` - library paging, updates,
 * history, feeds, backups, Discord presence - sees the edited title without threading
 * a repository through all of them. That initialiser is synchronous and can run on the
 * db reader pool, the main thread, or inside a mapper, so reads have to be a plain map
 * lookup. This class therefore keeps a process-wide cache in front of the table: a write
 * updates the cache synchronously (so the edit is visible in the very next `Manga` the UI
 * builds) and is then flushed to SQLite in order by a single writer.
 *
 * ## Why writes are queued instead of executed inline
 *
 * Callers include `LibraryScreenModel.cleanTitles` / `resetInfo`, which write one row per
 * selected entry. The file-backed predecessor rewrote the entire JSON document on the
 * calling thread for each of those. A single-consumer channel keeps the writes strictly
 * ordered (last write wins, no interleaving between two edits of the same entry) and off
 * the caller's thread.
 *
 * ## Legacy import
 *
 * Before this existed, edits lived in `<external files>/edits.json` - outside the
 * database, so they were dropped on uninstall, missing from db exports, and invisible to
 * the backup integrity machinery. [migrateLegacyFile] imports that file once on first
 * construction - during `App.onCreate` - and *renames* it rather than deleting it, so an
 * import that could not be completed is retried on the next launch instead of silently
 * destroying the user's edits.
